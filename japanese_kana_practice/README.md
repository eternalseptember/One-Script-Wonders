Some scripts for practicing Japanese hiragana and katakana.

index.html leads to the main single-page application with flashcard settings. Random cards based on the specified options will be shown for practice. Harder kana can be saved for review later, and the review deck can be accessed through the "Review" button. Click on the kana to hear its pronunciation. 

soundchart.html is like the "prototype", and it's separate from the rest of the application. This chart was reimplemented in AngularJS and can be accessed by the "Kana Chart" tab.
