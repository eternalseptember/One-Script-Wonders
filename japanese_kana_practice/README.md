Some scripts for practicing Japanese hiragana and katakana.

index.html leads to the main single-page application with flashcard settings. Cards based on the specified options will be shown for practice. Work in progress.

soundchart.html is like the "prototype", and it's separate from the rest of the application. This chart was reimplemented in AngularJS and can be accessed by the "Kana Chart" tab.
